Network Security Lab: Device Configuration and Attack Simulation


Project Overview

This project involves creating and configuring a secure network using Cisco routers, switches, firewalls, PCs, and servers, with a simulated attack scenario. The task is based on a network diagram provided in a Day 1 instructional video and is executed using Cisco Packet Tracer. The primary focus of the lab is to establish a secure network environment while preparing for potential security breaches simulated by an "attacker" laptop.

Objectives:

-Network Topology Creation: Recreate the network diagram as displayed at 16:40 of the Day 1 video using Cisco Packet Tracer. This involves connecting various network devices, including routers, switches, firewalls, PCs, servers, and an attacker laptop.

-Device Configuration: Configure each device to ensure proper communication across the network. This includes setting up IP addressing, routing protocols, and firewall rules to enforce network security.

-Security Implementation: Use Cisco ASA 5505 firewalls to create and manage security policies that protect the internal network from potential attacks simulated by the attacker laptop.

-Attack Simulation: Utilize the laptop as an "attacker" device within the network diagram to simulate an external threat. The attacker will attempt to breach network security, providing a practical scenario for testing firewall configurations and other security measures.

-Automatic Connection Setup: Utilize Packet Tracer’s 'Automatically Choose Connection Type' function to connect the devices, simplifying the setup process while ensuring that the correct cables and interfaces are used for each connection.

Key Features
Network Devices Used:

-Cisco 2911 Routers (x2): Serve as the backbone of the network, routing traffic between different segments.
-Cisco 2960 Switches (x2): Manage network traffic within local segments and connect end devices.
-Cisco ASA 5505 Firewalls (x2): Provide critical security functions, including packet filtering, NAT, and VPN support.
-PCs (x2) and Servers (x2): Represent end-user devices and critical network resources.
-Attacker Laptop: Simulates an external threat to test network defenses.

Automatic Cable Selection: Packet Tracer's 'Automatically Choose Connection Type' function is employed to connect devices. This feature ensures that the appropriate connection type (e.g., straight-through or crossover) is automatically selected based on the devices being connected, streamlining the network setup.

Network Security Testing: The project focuses heavily on security, using the attacker laptop to simulate real-world attack scenarios. The effectiveness of the firewall configurations and other security measures is tested by attempting to infiltrate the network from this external device.

Firewall Configuration: The Cisco ASA 5505 firewalls are configured with appropriate security policies to protect the network. This includes setting up access control lists (ACLs), stateful packet inspection, and ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed into or out of the network.

Routing and IP Addressing: The routers are configured to handle the internal routing between network segments. This includes static or dynamic routing protocols to ensure efficient data flow across the network.

Learning Outcomes:

Network Design and Implementation: Learn how to design and implement a secure network topology using Cisco devices.

Security Policy Configuration: Gain hands-on experience configuring firewall security policies to protect against potential network threats.

Simulated Attack Response: Understand how to simulate and respond to network attacks, testing the robustness of your security measures.

Device Interconnection: Practice connecting various network devices using automated tools in Packet Tracer, ensuring proper network setup.

Conclusion:
This project serves as a comprehensive exercise in network security, combining the design, implementation, and protection of a complex network using Cisco devices. By configuring routers, switches, firewalls, and simulating potential security threats, it offers hands-on experience in building a secure network infrastructure. The project not only enhances understanding of network topology and device interconnection but also deepens knowledge of cybersecurity practices. It’s an invaluable learning experience for anyone looking to develop practical skills in both network design and defense strategies.
